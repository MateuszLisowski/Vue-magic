## Idea and functionality

It's a basic self-development app to test Vue and connected skills, which I want to improve.
It contains authentication mechanism, which allows users to login/log out and also manage your profile.
For example buying premium or change lastname/surname.
Every data is stored in firebase backend and fetched to vuex store during login.

## TODO

1. Improve responsiveness
2. Refactor HTML and CSS code (repetitions + rewrite to BEM)
3. Refactor JS to avoid repetitions
4. Store notification messages in separate file
